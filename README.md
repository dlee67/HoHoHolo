# PhaseHackathon


## Inspiration
We never had a good experience with trying to utilize a database in any of our project, 
disregarding if it's NoSQL or SQL.â€‹
## What it does
Particle devices has this utility called WebHooks, where we can make HTTP request to a specified host, where
Holochain application can get hosted with domain name of user's choice and be utilized by user with incoming POST requests.
For example, holoapp.com/fn/zomename/someFunction will invoke the execution of the codebse in someFunction()
of Holochain application, and be stored inside it's distributed hash table.

## Challenges we ran into
Lack of hardware to increase the convenience.

## What's next for HoHoHolo
Use this proof of concepts to further promote Holochain.
